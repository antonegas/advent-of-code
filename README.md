All my advent of code solutions

# Notes
- Day 7: main.py doesn't currently solves part 1.
- Day 8: main.py was not the code I used to solve part 2. It probably could solve part 2, but it is inefficient.
- Day 9: main.py doesn't print all solutions.
- Day 11: main.py probably could be more efficient and currently doesn't solve part 1.
- Day 12: main.py was my initial solution, but main2.py is more efficient due to the recursive calls with memoization.

# Fun Facts
- Day 5: took me almost a week to get a efficient solution to.
