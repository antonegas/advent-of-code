All my advent of code solutions

# Notes
- main.py for a given day is almost always my initial solution and main2.py is my attempt at making it more efficient.

# Fun Facts
- Day 5 took me almost a week to get a working and efficient solution to. 
- Day 8's main.py and main2.py was not the code I used to solve part 2, main.py probably could solve part 2, but it is inefficient, main2.py does solve it.
- Day 11's main2.py gives the answers to both parts in 1 / 16 the time it takes main.py to solve one part.
- Day 12's main.py was my initial solution, but main2.py is much more efficient due to the recursive calls with memoization.
- My original solution for day 19's part 2 was correct except for a small bug which made me waste multiple hours looking for the an other solution, only to go back to my original solution and implementing it correctly that time.
