All my advent of code solutions

# Explanations
- main.py for a given day is almost always my initial solution and main2.py is my attempt at making it more efficient.

# Notes
- Day 7: main.py doesn't currently solves part 1.
- Day 8: main.py was not the code I used to solve part 2. It probably could solve part 2, but it is inefficient.
- Day 12: main.py was my initial solution, but main2.py is more efficient due to the recursive calls with memoization.

# Fun Facts
- Day 5 took me almost a week to get a working and efficient solution to. 
- Day 11's main2.py gives the answers to both parts in 1 / 16 the time it takes main.py to solve one part.
