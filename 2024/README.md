All my advent of code solutions for 2024

# Notes
- main.py for a given day is almost always my initial solution and main2.py is my attempt at making it more efficient.

# Fun Facts
- Day 6 it took one extra hour to solve part 2 because I placed an obstruction on the starting position. I'm guessing that I was unlucky with my input because I have seen solutions which don't account for this.
- Day 7 took about 30 minutes extra because I used ljust instead of rjust to pad my binary strings.
- Day 10 part 1 took a long time because I read the description wrong and solved part 2 instead.
- Day 11 decided to run the brute force solution for part 2 (main.py) for a while before I started a real solution (main2.py). Brute force ran for 20 minutes while I ate breakfast and brushed my teeth, without finding the answer to part 2. The cached solution found the answer to part 2 in less than a second.
